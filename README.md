Currently working at [GD](https://gdbusiness.id/) as a Full Stack Developer.

Self taught using [Harvard's CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). <br>
6 months after that I landed my full stack web dev job at [Platon](https://platon.co.id/). <br>
6 months after Platon, I landed my full time job at [Innovate](https://www.innovate.partners/). <br>
3 months in on Innovate, I got laid off due to their business quieted down. <br>
Thanks to my freelance client referral, I secured a new job shortly after (literrally 3 days after). Now I'm working at GD. ðŸš€
