- 👋 I'm Reza
- 🔧 Java(Type)script

Currently working at [GD](https://gdbusiness.id/) as a Full Stack Developer.

Self taught, *on May 2023*, using [Harvard's CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
6 months after that I landed my full stack web dev job at [Platon](https://platon.co.id/) *(December 2023)*.
6 months after Platon, I landed my full time job at [Innovate](https://www.innovate.partners/).
3 months in on Innovate, I got laid off due to their business quieted down.
Thanks to referral, I secured a new job shortly after (literrally 3 days after). Now I'm working at GD. 🚀
