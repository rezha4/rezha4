#### Currently working at [GD](https://gdbusiness.id/) as a Full Stack Developer. Self taught, *on May 2023*, using [Harvard's CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). 6 months after that I landed my full stack web dev job at [Platon](https://platon.co.id/) *(December 2023)*. 6 months after Platon, I landed my full time job at Innovate. 3 months in on Innovate, I got laid off. Thanks to referral, I secured a new job shortly after (literrally 3 days after). Now I'm working at GD. 🚀
