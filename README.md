### Hi there 👋

I'm Rezha, from Surabaya, Indonesia.

I am a full stack engineer, specializing in web app development.
My current stack is the MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

I am self taught by CS50 from Harvard and the awesome The Odin Project.
6 months later I landed my full stack job at Platon (December 2023).
